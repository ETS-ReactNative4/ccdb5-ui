    Consumer Complaint Database
  </h1>
  <p>
    Consumer complaints are added to this public database after the company has responded to the complaint, confirming a commercial relationship with the consumer, or after they\'ve had the complaint for 15 calendar days, whichever comes first. We donâ€™t verify all the facts alleged in complaints, but we do give companies the opportunity to publicly respond to complaints by selecting responses from a pre-populated list. Company-level information should be considered in the context of company size and/or market share.
